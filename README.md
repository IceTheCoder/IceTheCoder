### Hi ðŸ‘‹
#### I am a 14-year-old passionate about learning to code.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
  * [light game](https://github.com/IceTheDev2/light-game), a game with a unique mechanic of controlling a light that gets larger the faster the quicker you move your cursor (Unity and C#).
  * [Passwordsy](https://github.com/IceTheDev2/Passwordsy), a password generator and a password strength checker (Python and Tkinter).
  * [my blog](https://icethedev2.github.io/), a mostly weekly blog.
  * [simple-maths-games](https://github.com/IceTheDev2/simple-maths-games), a quite-basic maths learning app in its early stages (Unity and C#).
  * [cube game](https://github.com/IceTheDev2/cube-game), a game based on Brackeys's ['How to Make a Video Game'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6) series (Unity and C#).
